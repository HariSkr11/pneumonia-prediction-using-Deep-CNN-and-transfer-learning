# Pneumonia Prediction with Deep CNN and Transfer Learning

## About
Pneumonia, a formidable lung infection, demands our collective attention. This project seeks to predict it accurately using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning.

## Dataset
Our foundation lies in the Kaggle dataset, which you can access [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). This comprehensive dataset fuels our predictive prowess.

## Methodology
We've crafted three distinct models, each a testament to our dedication. After rigorous testing, we've identified the top two performers. These models harness the power of CNN and transfer learning to elevate accuracy and impact.

## Conclusion
In the battle against pneumonia, precision is our greatest ally. Through innovative CNN models and the knowledge transfer from established techniques, we've advanced our ability to detect this insidious lung infection.

With continued collaboration and refinement, we aspire to make a significant impact on pneumonia diagnosis.
